# ‚ù§Ô∏è CardioSpectra: Heart Disease Analysis - EDA

## üìù Description
This project focuses on conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset. The primary objective is to understand the dataset's distribution, identify patterns, detect outliers and anomalies, and visualize relationships between variables to gain insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD).

## üìä Dataset
The analysis utilizes the `heart.csv` dataset, which contains 303 instances (rows) and 14 variables (columns) related to heart disease.

## üìã Features/Columns
The dataset includes the following variables:
* `age`: Age in years
* `sex`: (1 = male; 0 = female)
* `cp`: Chest pain type
* `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
* `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
* `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
* `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
* `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
* `exang`: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
* `thal`: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
* `target`: Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Highlights
The EDA journey explored various aspects of the dataset, including:
* **Univariate Analysis**: Examining individual variable distributions.
* **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**: Understanding relationships between two or more variables.
* **Missing Value Detection**: Checking for and addressing any missing data (none found in this dataset).
* **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling anomalous data points.
* **Visualization**: Extensive use of plots (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, etc.) to reveal patterns and insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
* NumPy (for numerical operations)
* Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Seaborn (for enhanced data visualization)
* SciPy (for statistical functions)

## üöÄ How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd CardioSpectra
    ```
2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy jupyter
    ```
3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Heart Disease Analysis-EDA .ipynb"
    ```
    This will open the notebook in your web browser, where you can execute the cells to see the analysis..

## üí° Conclusion
This EDA provides a solid foundation for understanding the heart disease dataset, revealing key characteristics, relationships, and potential areas for further predictive modeling. The insights gained are crucial for developing effective strategies to analyze and predict heart disease.
